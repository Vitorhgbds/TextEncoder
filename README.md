# TextEncoder
This program is suited for read, write, encode and decode a text file.

# How it works
First of all, you need to fill the input.txt file with the message that you want. 
When the program starts, two options are displayed in console: [0] to encode and [1] to decode a message. So the program will run the choosen command and display the result in console and write the out.txt file.

# Thanks for reading ;)
If you are looking for my thinking process to code the decode solution, please check the Wiki page.
